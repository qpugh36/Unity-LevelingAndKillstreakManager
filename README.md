This is a collection of scripts that allow you to add player leveling, ranks, kill tracking, and killstreaks to your Unity game. These scripts were built with the use of Cowsin's FPS engine and Emerald AI 3.0, and can be modified to fit your game's damage system if needed.

To use these scripts, you'll need to add the manager scripts to your game manager. The code saves data to player prefs, which persists through scene changes, and a player ID system is included to support multiple players.

Installation
Clone or download the repository.
Open your Unity project.
Import the scripts into your project.
Add the manager scripts to your game manager.
Usage
Once the scripts are installed, you can use them to add player progression and tracking features to your Unity game. The scripts include the following features:

Player leveling
Ranks
Kill tracking
Killstreaks
The scripts are designed to work with Emerald AI 3.0, but you can modify the damage system to fit your game's needs.

The scripts save data to player prefs, which means that the data will persist through scene changes. The player ID system is also included to support multiple players.
